# Personal Website

This is my personal website, fully built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. I designed and coded it from scratch, using **HTML `<canvas>`** for some interactive graphics.

The website is still under development, with new features and improvements being added regularly as I continue to get new ideas on how to enhance it. It was created to practice building a **single-page application (SPA)** and to further improve my front-end development skills.
