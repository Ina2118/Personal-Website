# Personal Website
This is my personal website, fully built from scratch using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It serves as both my online CV and a playground for experimenting with new ideas and visual concepts.

The website includes interactive elements implemented with the **HTML5 Canvas API**, used mainly for dynamic background graphics.

## 🚧 Work in Progress
The project is continuously evolving as I explore new ideas and techniques.  
I actively use it to experiment, refactor, and improve both functionality and user experience over time.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript
- HTML5 Canvas API

## 📂 Project Structure
- `assets/` – Folder containing all images and icons used in the website
- `index.html` – Main HTML file for the website structure  
- `mediaqueries.css` – Responsive styles using media queries for different screen sizes, including navigation and buttons  
- `particles-bg.js` – Canvas animation logic for interactive background particles

## ▶️ Run Locally
Open `index.html` in your browser,  
or start the project using a local server, e.g., the **Live Server** extension in Visual Studio Code.

## 🎯 Purpose
- Practice building a simple single-page application (SPA)
- Experiment with interactive visuals and animations
- Improve front-end development skills and code structure
